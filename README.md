# Destinations | Places that you Love
This is my first MERN stack app.

You can access the app at https://sarveshmokhare-destinations.netlify.app

On the app, you can add places which you love by clicking on "Add Place" button at the right top corner in the navigation bar.

Once they are added, you will be redirected to the home page and you can view temperature and weather description of the added place by clicking on the place.

Share the app with your friends and ask them to add more places. Enjoy!

PS: Make sure you add proper name of the place so that the correct weather information is displayed.
